# Puppet module for managing Foreman integration in Puppetserver

The Foreman integration consists of an ENC and a report processor. This has a
configuration file. All of this can be managed by this module.

Historically this integration was part of [theforeman-foreman
module](https://github.com/theforeman/puppet-foreman).

## Compatibility

Foreman API v2: 1.3 - 2.x
Puppetserver: 1.x - 6.x

These scripts have a long history and have basically been unchanged since
Puppet 2.6, even before Puppetserver existed. Since they haven't dropped code,
they probably still work.
